# Uart-FRDM-KL25z
A device driver is implemented for the UART serial communication for the FRDM KL25z. 
A circular buffer is implemented to store the characters to be sent and received via UART.
A report is generated which displays the occurrences of all the characters entered by the user via UART, along with the Fibinocci series.

Completed as part of Project 2 towards the graduate course "Principles of Embedded Software".
